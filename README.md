# Stock Web Toolkit
This is an evlovling project to provide a stock toolkit to help in picking stocks and creating wealth over time.

Currently in use:
- Ian MacDonald's Stock Picking Scoring System
- IEX Finance for financial inforation
- Database to store already scored stocks to limit calls to IEX

Need to add:
- Analysis of price and volume to look for opportunities
- Ability to override historical financials and get fresh ones
- News Scrape and identification of trending companies/symbols
- Reddit scrape for the same
- Export to CSV for Evaluated Stocks
- Update to function in other non-us Exchanges (https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/#international-exchanges) Seems like real time quotes are not available on this API (https://intercom.help/iexcloud/en/articles/4063782-international-data) for anything but US stocks
- Add ability to look up more than one stock at a time
